        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Two years ago my husband decided to accept an offer from his company to move to Seattle. Since then I have been dividing my life between two continents. At the end of 2016 I decided to move completely to Seattle and to build my professional life here.
          The last half year I devoted to improving my language skills. I joined A.C.E. Language Institute at Seattle Pacific University which gave me the opportunity to create great relationships and to better understand American culture.
          I value working with people. I enjoy practicing with great coworkers, learning from them and building strong relationships with them. I value the positive atmosphere in the workplace and the opportunity for personal and professional development.

        <h3>Why programming</h3>
          <p>
            Few months ago I decided to completely change my career. Since the only chance to continue my previous one was to go back to school I decided that I really want to learn something new and exciting. The career in programming field seamed to be the most obvious to me. My husband who is working as a programmer for over 10 years is a big inspiration to me. I am really impressed how he can improve our everyday life using his programmer skills. This is a future for our society. There  in no excuse now to be not familiar with computers. That is how I decided to keep up to date with modern world.
